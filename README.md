# Tools

* [Remix Ethereum](http://remix.ethereum.org/)
* MetaMask

## General information 

Each Smart Contract can be executed via Remix (or Ganache). 
In this instance I deployed the Smart Contract via Remix with a real time visualization through MetaMask upon execution of the contract. 
To replicate this contract, I've used the Ropsten Test Network. In case you need any Ethereum in your test wallet, you can do so through [Faucet Ropsten](https://faucet.ropsten.be/). 

### Smart Contract 1 - AssociateProfitSplitter.sol

Steps to take to run the contract: 
1. Set the compiler to 0.5+ 
2. Deploy the contract by adding the addresses of the recipients _(I've added test addresses in the code in case)_
3. Deposit a value (eg. 1 ether) _ensure to set the ether counter to 1, then hit deposit_ 
4. Your MetaMask wallet will request you to approve the transaction
